    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you and SweetHome that govern the right to
      use the websites, applications, and other offerings from SweetHome (collectively, the “SweetHome Platform”). When
      used in these Terms, “SweetHome,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to the SweetHome entity set out on Schedule 1 with
      whom you are contracting.

      The SweetHome Platform enables users (“Members”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services. Members who
      publish and offer services are “Hosts” and Members who search for, book, or use services are “Guests.” Hosts offer
      accommodations (“Accommodations”), activities, excursions, and events (“Experiences”), and a variety of travel and
      other services (collectively, “Host Services,” and each Host Service offering, a “Listing”). As the provider of
      the SweetHome Platform, SweetHome does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings or Host Services. SweetHome
      is not a party to the contracts entered into directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is SweetHome a real estate
      broker, travel agency, or insurer. SweetHome is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as
      specified in the Payments Terms of Service (“Payment Terms”). To learn more about SweetHome’s role see Section 15.

      We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms like our Privacy Policy, which describes our
      collection and use of personal data, and our Payments Terms, which govern any payment services provided to Members
      by the SweetHome payment entities (collectively "SweetHome Payments").
    </p>
    <section id="subtitle1">
      <h2>1. Searching and Booking on SweetHome.</h2>
      <p>
        1.1 Searching. You can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type of Host Service, type of
        listing, travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests. You can also use filters to refine your search
        results. Search results are based on their relevance to your search and other criteria. Relevance considers
        factors like price, availability, Reviews, customer service and cancellation history, popularity, previous trips
        and saved Listings, Host requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights), and more. Learn more about search
        results in our Help Center.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.2 Booking. When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your booking including the Listing
        price, applicable fees like SweetHome’s service fee, offline fees, taxes, and any other items identified during
        checkout (collectively, “Total Price”). If you choose to pay using a currency that differs from the currency set
        by the Host for their Listing, the price displayed to you is based on a currency conversion rate determined by
        us. You are also agreeing that SweetHome via SweetHome Payments may charge the Payment Method (as defined in the
        Payment Terms) used to book the Listing in order to collect Damage Claim (as defined in Section 14) amounts.

        When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Host Services (a "Reservation") is formed directly
        between you and the Host. By making a Reservation you are agreeing to the terms of the contract. The terms of
        the contract include these Terms, all terms of the Reservation, including without limitation, the cancellation
        policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Listing or during checkout
        that apply to the Reservation. It is your responsibility to read and understand these terms of the contract
        including these Terms and all terms of the Reservation including all rules, standards, policies, and
        requirements prior to booking a Listing. Be aware that some Hosts work with a co-host or as part of a team to
        provide their Host Services.
      </p>
      <p>1.3 Accommodation Reservations. An Accommodation Reservation is a limited license to enter, occupy, and use the
        Accommodation. The Host retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation during your stay, to the extent: (i) it
        is reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the Host, and (iii) permitted by applicable law.
        If you stay past checkout, the Host has the right to make you leave in a manner permitted with applicable law,
        including by imposing reasonable overstay penalties. You may not exceed the maximum number of allowed Guests.
      </p>
      <p>1.4 Reservations for Experiences and Other Host Services. An Experience or other Host Service Reservation
        entitles you to participate in, attend, or use that Host Service. You are responsible for confirming that you,
        and anyone you invite, meet minimum age, proficiency, fitness, or other requirements. You are responsible for
        informing the Host of any medical or physical conditions, or other circumstances that may impact your ability to
        participate, attend, or use the Experience or Host Service. Except where expressly authorized, you may not allow
        any person to join an Experience or Host Service unless they are included as an additional guest during the
        booking process.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="subtitle2">
      <h2>2. Cancellations, Reservation Issues, Refunds and Booking Modifications.</h2>
      <p>
        2.1 Cancellations, Reservation Issues, and Refunds. In general, if you cancel a Reservation, the amount refunded
        to you is determined by the Host's cancellation policy that applies to that Reservation. But, in certain
        situations, other policies take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you. If something outside
        your control forces you to cancel a Reservation, you may be eligible for a partial or full refund under our
        Extenuating Circumstances Policy. If the Host cancels, or you experience a Reservation Issue (as defined in our
        Rebooking and Refund Policy), you may be eligible for rebooking assistance or a partial or full refund under the
        Rebooking and Refund Policy. Different policies apply to certain categories of Listings; for example Experiences
        Reservations are governed by the Experiences Guest Refund Policy. See each Additional Legal Term or Policy for
        details about what is covered, and what refund applies in each situation. You may appeal a decision by SweetHome by
        contacting our customer service.
      </p>
      <p>2.2 Booking Modifications. Guests and Hosts are responsible for any booking modifications they agree to make
        via the SweetHome Platform or direct SweetHome customer service to make on their behalf ("Booking Modifications"), and
        agree to pay any additional amounts, fees, or taxes associated with any Booking Modification.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="subtitle3">
      <h2>3. Your Responsibilities and Assumption of Risk.</h2>
      <p>
        3.1 Your Responsibilities. You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also
        responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or provide access to any Accommodation, all
        areas and facilities where the Accommodation is located that the Host and Guest are legally entitled to use in
        connection with the Accommodation (“Common Areas”), or any Experience or other Host Service. For example, this
        means: (i) you are responsible for leaving an Accommodation (and related personal property) or Common Areas in
        the condition it was in when you arrived, (ii) you are responsible for paying all reasonable Damage Claim
        amounts, and (iii) you must act with integrity, treat others with respect, and comply with applicable laws at
        all times. If you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring a minor to a Host Service,
        you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor and you are solely responsible for the supervision
        of that minor.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.2 Your Assumption of Risk. You acknowledge that many activities carry inherent risks and agree that, to the
        maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of
        the SweetHome Platform and any Content (as defined in Section 9), including your stay at any Accommodation,
        participation in any Experience, use of any other Host Service, or any other interaction you have with other
        Members whether in person or online. This means it is your responsibility to investigate a Host Service to
        determine whether it is suitable for you. For example, Host Services may carry risk of illness, bodily injury,
        disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those Host
        Services.

      <h1>Host Terms</h1>
      <h2>4. Hosting on SweetHome./h2>
        <p>
          4.1 Host. As a Host, SweetHome offers you the right to use the SweetHome Platform in accordance with these Terms to
          share your Accommodation, Experience, or other Host Service with our vibrant community of Guests - and earn
          money doing it. It’s easy to create a Listing and you are in control of how you host - set your price,
          availability, and rules for each Listing.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.2 Contracting with Guests. When you accept a booking request, or receive a booking confirmation through the
          SweetHome Platform, you are entering into a contract directly with the Guest, and are responsible for delivering
          the Host Service under the terms and at the price specified in your Listing. You are also agreeing to pay
          applicable fees like SweetHome’s service fee (and applicable taxes) for each booking. SweetHome Payments will deduct
          amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you agree to a different method. Any terms or conditions that
          you include in any supplemental contract with Guests must: (i) be consistent with these Terms, our Additional
          Legal Terms, Policies, and the information provided in your Listing, and (ii) be prominently disclosed in your
          Listing description.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.3 Independence of Hosts. Your relationship with SweetHome is that of an independent individual or entity and
          not an employee, agent, joint venturer, or partner of SweetHome, except that SweetHome Payments acts as a payment
          collection agent as described in the Payments Terms. SweetHome does not direct or control your Host Service, and
          you understand that you have complete discretion whether and when to provide Host Services, and at what price
          and on what terms to offer them.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="subtitle5">
      <h2>5. Managing Your Listing.</h2>
      <p>
        5.1 Creating and Managing Your Listing. The SweetHome Platform provides tools that make it easy for you to set up
        and manage a Listing. Your Listing must include complete and accurate information about your Host Service, your
        price, other charges like cleaning fees, resort fees, offline fees, and any rules or requirements that apply to
        your Guests or Listing. You are responsible for your acts or omissions as well as keeping your Listing
        information (including calendar availability) and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times.
        You are responsible for obtaining appropriate insurance for your Host Services and we suggest you carefully
        review policy terms and conditions including coverage details and exclusions. You may only maintain one Listing
        per Accommodation, but may have multiple Listings for a single property if it has multiple places to stay. Any
        offer of an Experience is subject to our Additional Terms for Experience Hosts.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.2 Know Your Legal Obligations. You are responsible for understanding and complying with any laws, rules,
        regulations, and contracts with third parties that apply to your Listing or Host Services. For example: Some
        landlords and leases, or homeowner and condominium association rules, restrict or prohibit subletting,
        short-term rentals and/or longer-term stays. Some cities have zoning or other laws that restrict the short-term
        rental of residential properties. Some jurisdictions require Hosts to register, get a permit, or obtain a
        license before providing certain Host Services (such as short-term rentals, longer-term stays, preparing food,
        serving alcohol for sale, guiding tours, or operating a vehicle). In some places, the Host Services you want to
        offer may be prohibited altogether. Some jurisdictions require that you register Guests who stay at your
        Accommodation. Some jurisdictions have laws that create tenancy rights for Guests and additional obligations for
        Hosts. For example, some places have landlord-tenant, rent control, and eviction laws that may apply to longer
        stays. Check your local rules to learn what rules apply to the Host Services you plan to offer. Information we
        provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should independently confirm
        your obligations. You are responsible for handling and using personal data of Guests and others in compliance
        with applicable privacy laws and these Terms, including our Host Privacy Standards. If you have questions about
        how local laws apply you should always seek legal advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.3 Search Results. The ranking of Listings in search results on the SweetHome Platform depends on a variety of
        factors, including these main parameters:
        <li>Guest search parameters (e.g. number of Guests, destination, time and duration of the trip, price range),
        </li>
        <li>Listing characteristics (e.g. price, calendar availability, number and quality of images, Reviews, type of
          Host Service, Host status, length of time the Listing has been live on the SweetHome Platform, Guest engagement
          and popularity),</li>
        <li>Guest experience (e.g. customer service and cancellation history of the Host, ease of booking),</li>
        <li>Host and Listing requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights, booking cut-off time), and</li>
        <li>Guest preferences and history (e.g. previous trips, viewed and saved Listings, location from where the Guest
          is searching).</li>
        Search results may be different on our mobile application than on our website, and may also differ in the map
        view. SweetHome may allow Hosts to promote their Listings in search or elsewhere on the SweetHome Platform by paying
        an additional fee. More information about the factors that determine how your Listing appears in search results,
        our current promotional programs (if any), and how we identify promoted Content can be found in our Help Center.

      </p>
      <p>
        5.4 Your Responsibilities. You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also
        responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you allow to participate in providing your Host Services. You
        are responsible for setting your price and establishing rules and requirements for your Listing. You must
        describe any and all fees and charges in your Listing description and may not collect any additional fees or
        charges outside the SweetHome Platform except those expressly authorized by our Offline Fee Policy. Do not
        encourage Guests to create third-party accounts, submit reviews, provide their contact information, or take
        other actions outside the SweetHome Platform in violation of our Off-Platform Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.5 Hosting as a Team or Organization. If you work with a co-host or host as part of a team, business, or other
        organization, you are responsible and liable as a Host under these Terms for the acts and omissions of each
        entity and individual who participates in providing your Host Services and you are responsible for informing
        personnel engaged by you to deliver any Host Services of your obligations under these Terms. If you accept terms
        or enter into contracts with third parties, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into
        contracts for and bind your team, business or other organization, and that each entity you use is in good
        standing under the laws of the place where it is established. If you perform other functions, you represent and
        warrant that you are authorized to perform those functions. If you instruct SweetHome to transfer a portion of your
        payout to a co-host or other Hosts, or send payments to someone else, you must be authorized to do so, and are
        responsible and liable for the payment amounts and accuracy of any payout information you provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.6 Your Assumption of Risk. You acknowledge that hosting carries inherent risks and agree that you assume the
        entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the SweetHome Platform, offering Host Services, or any
        interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online. You agree that you have had the opportunity
        to investigate the SweetHome Platform and any laws, rules, regulations, or obligations that may be applicable to
        your Listings or Host Services and that you are not relying upon any statement of law made by SweetHome.

    <section id="subtitle6">
      <h2>6. Cancellations, Reservation Issues, and Booking Modifications.</h2>


      <p>
        6.1 Cancellations and Reservation Issues. In general, if a Guest cancels a Reservation, the amount paid to you
        is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that Reservation. As a host, you should not cancel on a
        Guest without a valid reason under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy or applicable law. If you cancel on a
        Guest without such a valid reason, we may impose a cancellation fee and other consequences. If: (i) a Guest
        experiences a Reservation Issue (as defined by the Rebooking and Refund Policy), (ii) an Extenuating
        Circumstance arises, or (iii) a Reservation is canceled under Section 12 of these Terms, the amount you are paid
        will be reduced by the amount we refund or otherwise provide to the Guest, and by any other reasonable costs we
        incur as a result of the cancellation. If a Guest receives a refund after you have already been paid, or the
        amount of the refund and other costs incurred by SweetHome exceeds your payout, SweetHome (via SweetHome Payments) may
        recover that amount from you, including by deducting the refund against your future payouts. You agree that
        SweetHome’s Rebooking and Refund Policy, Extenuating Circumstances Policy, and these Terms preempt the cancellation
        policy you set in situations where they allow for the cancellation of a Reservation and/or the issuance of
        refunds to Guests. If we reasonably expect to provide a refund to a Guest under one of these policies, we may
        delay release of any payout for that Reservation until a refund decision is made. If you Host an Experience
        please note that the Experience Cancellation Policy, Experiences Guest Refund Policy and different cancellation
        fees and consequences apply to your Reservations. See each Policy for details about what is covered, and what
        your payout will be in each situation.
      </p>
      <p>6.2 Booking Modifications. Hosts and Guests are responsible for any Booking Modifications they agree to make
        via the SweetHome Platform or direct SweetHome customer service to make on their behalf, and agree to pay any
        additional amounts, fees or taxes associated with a Booking Modification.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="subtitle7">
      <h2>7. Taxes.</h2>
      <p>
        7.1 Host Taxes. As a Host, you are responsible for determining and fulfilling your obligations under applicable
        laws to report, collect, remit, or include in your price any applicable VAT or other indirect taxes, occupancy
        taxes, tourist, income, or other taxes ("Taxes").
      </p>
      <p>
        7.2 Collection and Remittance by SweetHome. In jurisdictions where SweetHome facilitates the collection and/or
        remittance of Taxes on behalf of Hosts, you instruct and authorize SweetHome to collect Taxes on your behalf,
        and/or to remit such Taxes to the relevant Tax authority. Any Taxes that are collected and/or remitted by SweetHome
        are identified to Members on their transaction records, as applicable. SweetHome may seek additional amounts from
        Members (including by deducting such amounts from future payouts) when the Taxes collected and/or remitted are
        insufficient to fully discharge that Members’ tax obligations, and you agree that your sole remedy for Taxes
        collected by SweetHome is a refund from the applicable Tax authority. You acknowledge and agree that we retain the
        right, with prior notice to affected Members, to cease the collection and remittance of Taxes in any
        jurisdiction for any reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        7.3 Tax Information. In certain jurisdictions, Tax regulations may require that we collect and/or report Tax
        information about you, or withhold Taxes from payouts to you, or both. If you fail to provide us with
        documentation that we determine to be sufficient to support any such obligation to withhold Taxes from payouts
        to you, we may withhold payouts up to the amount as required by law, until sufficient documentation is provided.
        You agree that SweetHome may issue on your behalf invoices or similar documentation for VAT, GST, consumption or
        other Taxes for your Host Services to facilitate accurate tax reporting.

      <h1>General Terms</h1>
      <h2>8. Reviews.</h2>
      <p>   
        After each Host Service, Guests and Hosts will have an opportunity to review each other. Your Review must be
        accurate and may not contain any discriminatory, offensive, defamatory, or other language that violates these
        Terms, applicable law, or our Content Policy or Review Policy. Reviews are not verified by SweetHome for accuracy

      <h2>9. Content.</h2>
      <p>
        Parts of the SweetHome Platform enable you to provide feedback, text, photos, audio, video, information, and other
        content (“Content”). By providing Content, in whatever form and through whatever means, you grant SweetHome a

        personal information, such Content will only be used for these purposes if such use complies with applicable
        data protection laws in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Where SweetHome pays for the creation of Content or
        facilitates its creation, SweetHome may own that Content, in which case supplemental terms or disclosures will say
        that. You are solely responsible for all Content that you provide and warrant that you either own it or are
        authorized to grant SweetHome the rights described in these Terms. You are responsible and liable if any of your
        Content violates or infringes the intellectual property or privacy rights of any third party. Content must
        comply with our Content Policy and Nondiscrimination Policy, which prohibit, among other things, discriminatory,
        obscene, harassing, deceptive, violent, and illegal content. You agree that SweetHome may make available services
        or automated tools to translate Content and that your Content may be translated using such services or tools.

        information about when service fees apply and how they are calculated can be found on our Service Fees page. Any
        applicable fees are disclosed to Guests before making a Booking. Except as otherwise provided on the SweetHome

        will provide Members notice of any fee changes before they become effective. Fee changes will not affect

        12.1 Term. The agreement between you and SweetHome reflected by these Terms is effective when you access the SweetHome

        via email or using any other contact information you have provided for your account. SweetHome may also terminate
        this agreement immediately and without notice and stop providing access to the SweetHome Platform if you breach
        these Terms, you violate our Additional Legal Terms, or Policies, you violate applicable laws, or we reasonably
        believe termination is necessary to protect SweetHome, its Members, or third parties. If your account has been
        inactive for more than two years, we may terminate your account without prior notice.</p>
